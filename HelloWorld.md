# HelloWorld.md

## This is a markdown file
This is a Github readme file, and has an extension of .md
The .md file is usually placed at the root level so that anybody visiting the GIT repo can get a quick overview about the project.

## R Markdown file
The Github .md file is different from an R markdown file, which has the extension of .Rmd, and can be edited from the RStudio. 
The R Markdown files are usually created for R project reports.
I have added a sample R Markdown file to my repo here: `https://github.com/rajendrakowta/datasciencecoursera/blob/main/HelloWorld.Rmd`
